For the first time
I'am doing just fine
because I know you're only mine
you make me feel so divine
It's hard to believe that it's real 
All my wounds are above to heal

you make me feel strong
you make me feel blessed
you make me feel I'm the best
you make me feel good
you make me feel
and you make me feel now I'am complete
